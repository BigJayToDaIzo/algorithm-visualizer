# Search Algorithm Visualizer

Personal Project to Showcase React/UI Skillset

# Description

The first commit of this project is a base tutorial I found on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msttfIHHkak&list=RDCMUCaO6VoaYJv4kS-TQO_M-N_g&start_radio=1&rv=msttfIHHkak&t=3299). I will expand greatly upon this tutorial to demonstrate to technical interviewers that I have strong React skills and a firm understanding of the various search algorithms. The tutorial did not use TDD so I will need to write the code to cover existing lines, then I will implement Test Driven Development best practices as I progress.

Big thanks to Cl√©ment Mihailescu over on [his YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@clem) for providing such a great idea and base for a tool to showcase my coding skills!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
